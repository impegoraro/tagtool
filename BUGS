Known Bugs:

- ID3v2 tags are always saved in Latin1 encoding.  (This is due to a bug 
  in the C binding of id3lib.)

- When tagging multiple files, it should be possible to clear a field by 
  checking it and leaving it empty.  Currently this does not work for mp3 
  files that have both v1 and v2 tags, unless other tag fields are also 
  being set to non-empty values  (Appears to be another id3lib bug)
