Abandon id3lib.  It's buggy and appears to no longer be maintained.
This will make it possible to fix th current ID3v2 encoding problems, 
and other minor bugs.

On-line help and documentation

Support more formats: FLAC, Musepack

Improvements of the MP3 frame header parsing. May need to parse the 
whole file rather than just the first frame:
 - More robust (don't confuse random data with valid frames)
 - Display the playing time of the file
 - Display correct info for VBR files

Misc features:
 - Option to show file list as a treeview
 - Mass copy ID3v1 to v2 (and vice-versa)
 - Mass case/character conversions
 - Auto-update playlists when renaming
 - freedb/musibrainz support (will need playing time of each file)
